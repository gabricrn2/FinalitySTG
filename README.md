*All assets besides music were included as their licenses (CC0) permit redistribution*. As a note, all the artwork was done by me and all SFX were gathered at [Freesound](https://freesound.org/).

This version lacks music as they were grabbed from [ZabSplat](www.zapsplat.com), and they can't be redistributed (here is [the license]('https://www.zapsplat.com/license-type/standard-license/')).
